I started to play around with the Arduino, as it is an awesome platform to 
start doing some hardware shit. For sure I started with a project that was
way to complicated for me (read about it at http://renegade.johnwulf.com), 
but I finally got the hardware done. As I am really a software guy, even 
though I studed EE, I felt that the software would benefit from some 
overhaul, at least I needed that for my project.

The repository contains my fork of existing Arduino libraries. These are not
the Arduino core libraries, but device specific and other libraries. The goal
of this is to bring the libraries to a "production" level and mix some object
oriented concepts into the Arduino libraries that promote easier reuse, 
greater flexibility, and faster development. 

At the moment, everything is structured so that it can be dropped into the 
Arduino enviroment, but at the same time can be compiled as a library and 
used outside of the the Arduino IDE, e.g. Eclipse, WinAVR, or the Atmel 
AVR Studio. The development itself is done in Eclipse on OS X using the 
AVR tool chain.

Anyway, this is just a start at this point, so any input is appreciated. In 
any case, I hope people will find some value in this and have fun.
